# Unity3DPocketSphinx-plugin (WIP)
# Archiving it because I don't have time to support it.
This is a plugin for Unity3D that gives the possibility to run PocketSphinx engine through Unity3D Game Engine. More on PocketSphinx can be found here: https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx

The demo is based on pocketsphinx-android-demo: https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx-android-demo

It's very *WIP*. Right now Android is the only supported platform.

The Android library is built with this project: https://github.com/dimixar/unity3DPocketSphinx-android-lib
